### 3.2 User Registration and Login
1. Create a new user account
2. Log in with the created account
3. Show the user dashboard

### 3.3 CV Upload and Analysis
1. Upload a sample CV (have one prepared)
2. Show how the system analyzes the CV
3. Demonstrate how the CV information is used to personalize the interview

### 3.4 Interview Simulation
1. Start a new interview session
2. Answer a series of questions (have some prepared answers)
3. Show how the AI adapts questions based on previous responses
4. Demonstrate the light/dark mode toggle

### 3.5 Session Analysis and Feedback
1. Complete the interview session
2. Show the session analysis page
3. Highlight the STAR-based feedback
4. Demonstrate how to review previous sessions

## 4. Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Material-UI
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy
- **Database**: SQLite

   - Integration with applicant tracking systems
   - Mobile app version for on-the-go practice

## 6. Demo Tips
1. Presentation Setup:
   - Use split screen to show code and application side by side
   - Have two terminals ready for backend and frontend
   - Prepare a sample CV in Word format
   - Test the application before the presentation
   - Have backup screenshots in case of technical issues

2. Key Points to Emphasize:
   - AI-driven personalization based on CV analysis
   - Adaptive question sequencing
   - STAR framework for structured feedback
   - Light/dark mode and responsive design
   - Session management and history

## 7. Example Questions and Answers for Demo
1. Behavioral:
   ```
   Q: Tell me about a time you had to meet a tight deadline.
   A: During my final year project, we had to deliver a working prototype in just two weeks. I broke down the project into daily milestones, prioritized core features, and coordinated with team members daily. We managed to deliver on time by focusing on the MVP first and adding enhancements later. This taught me the importance of prioritization and clear communication under pressure.
   ```

2. Technical:
   ```
   Q: Explain how you would design a database for this interview coaching application.
   A: I would create a relational database with tables for Users, Sessions, Questions, Responses, and Feedback. The Users table would store authentication details and profile information. Sessions would track interview sessions with timestamps and completion status. Questions would store the question bank with categories and difficulty levels. Responses would link users, sessions, and questions with the actual responses. Finally, the Feedback table would store AI-generated feedback with STAR ratings and improvement suggestions.
   ```

3. Situational:
   ```
   Q: How would you handle a situation where you disagree with your manager's approach?
   A: I would first seek to understand their perspective by asking clarifying questions. Then, I would present my alternative approach with data and reasoning, focusing on business outcomes rather than personal preferences. If we still disagree, I would respect their decision while documenting my concerns. In a previous internship, this approach led to a compromise solution that incorporated elements from both approaches and ultimately delivered better results.
   ```

## 8. Troubleshooting
If any issues occur during the demo:

1. Backend Issues:
   ```bash
   # Check if backend is running
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/time

   # Restart the backend
   python flask_app.py
   ```

2. Frontend Issues:
   ```bash
   # Check if frontend is running
   curl http://localhost:3000

   # Restart the frontend
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. Database Issues:
   ```bash
   # Check if database exists
   dir instance

   # If needed, create a new database
   python -c "from app.backend.db.models import db; db.create_all()"
   ```

4. Groq API Issues:
   ```bash
   # Check if Groq API key is set
   echo %GROQ_API_KEY%

   # Test Groq API connection
   python -c "import groq_client; print(groq_client.get_available_models())"
   ```

## 9. Success Metrics
