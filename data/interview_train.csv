How do you handle conflict at work?,"I don't really deal with conflict, I just ignore it and focus on my work.",0,conflict_resolution
Explain the concept of caching,Caching is storing frequently accessed data in a faster storage medium to improve performance. It reduces load on the main storage and speeds up data retrieval.,1,performance
Tell me about a time you had to learn something quickly,I just figure things out as I go.,0,learning_ability
Tell me about a time you failed,"During my first project management role, I underestimated the timeline for a software release. I learned to better estimate project scope and now include buffer time for unexpected challenges.",1,failure_recovery
How do you prioritize your work?,"I use a combination of urgency and importance to prioritize. I maintain a digital task list, set clear deadlines, and communicate my progress regularly with stakeholders.",1,organization
What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL?,"SQL databases are relational, structured, and use predefined schemas, while NoSQL databases are non-relational, flexible, and can handle unstructured data. NoSQL is better for scalability and handling large volumes of data.",1,database_types
Describe a challenging project you completed,"I recently managed a website redesign project under tight deadlines. I broke down the project into sprints, coordinated with stakeholders, and delivered on time while maintaining quality.",1,project_management
Explain the concept of Big O notation,It's about how fast code runs.,0,algorithms
How do you handle constructive criticism?,I usually just ignore criticism.,0,feedback_handling
Describe database normalization,Database normalization is the process of structuring a database to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity through organizing fields and tables of a database.,1,database
What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?,"Synchronous programming executes code sequentially, while asynchronous programming allows multiple operations to run concurrently. Asynchronous programming improves performance by not blocking the main thread.",1,programming_paradigms
Describe a time you had to work with a difficult team member,I avoid working with difficult people.,0,teamwork
Explain the concept of polymorphism,"Polymorphism allows objects to take multiple forms. In OOP, it enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms, improving code reusability and flexibility.",1,oop_concepts

Tell me about a time you failed,"I never fail at anything, I always succeed.",0,failure_recovery
Explain object-oriented programming,"OOP is a programming paradigm based on objects containing data and code. It uses concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction to organize code into reusable patterns.",1,programming_concepts
How do you make important decisions?,"I gather all relevant information, consider different perspectives, and evaluate potential outcomes. I also consult with team members when appropriate and document my reasoning.",1,decision_making
Tell me about a time you had to learn something quickly,"When I needed to learn a new programming language for a project, I created a structured learning plan, used online resources, and practiced with small projects. I also sought guidance from experienced colleagues.",1,learning_ability
Describe a time you had to work with a difficult team member,"I focus on understanding their perspective and finding common ground. I once worked with someone who had a different communication style, so I adapted my approach to ensure effective collaboration.",1,teamwork

How do you handle tight deadlines?,I just work harder when deadlines are tight.,0,time_management
What is REST API?,"REST API is an architectural style for building web services that use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to perform operations on resources, following stateless client-server communication.",1,web_development
Explain the concept of caching,It's storing data temporarily.,0,performance
What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL?,"SQL is for structured data, NoSQL isn't.",0,database_types
What is version control?,It's using Git.,0,development_tools
What's your greatest strength and weakness?,I don't have any weaknesses.,0,self_awareness
What is Docker and why is it used?,Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications and their dependencies into containers. It ensures consistency across different environments and makes deployment easier.,1,devops
Tell me about a time you showed leadership,I'm usually the one in charge because I'm better than others at making decisions.,0,leadership
What motivates you at work?,Money and promotions motivate me.,0,motivation
How do you handle conflict at work?,"I believe in addressing conflicts directly but professionally. Once, I had a disagreement with a colleague about project approach. I scheduled a private meeting to discuss our perspectives and found common ground.",1,conflict_resolution
Explain the concept of microservices,It's breaking down applications.,0,architecture
Explain the difference between HTTP and HTTPS,HTTPS is more secure than HTTP.,0,security
