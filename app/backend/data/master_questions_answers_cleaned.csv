"Tell me about yourself.","I'm a software engineer with 5 years of experience in web development. I specialize in building scalable applications using React and Node.js. In my current role at XYZ Corp, I led the development of a customer portal that improved user engagement by 40%. I'm passionate about clean code and user experience, and I'm looking for opportunities to grow my skills in cloud architecture.",behavioral,beginner,standard
"What is your greatest strength?","My greatest strength is my ability to solve complex problems. For example, at my previous job, we had a critical performance issue in our application. I took the initiative to analyze the bottlenecks, identified inefficient database queries, and implemented caching solutions that improved response times by 70%. I enjoy diving deep into challenging issues and finding elegant solutions.",behavioral,beginner,standard
"Describe a challenge you faced at work.","At my previous company, we were facing a tight deadline for a major client project, but we were understaffed. I volunteered to take on additional responsibilities and organized the team to prioritize critical features. I created a detailed project plan, held daily stand-ups to track progress, and identified areas where we could simplify implementation without compromising quality. As a result, we delivered the project on time, and the client was extremely satisfied with our work.",behavioral,intermediate,standard
"Why do you want this job?","I'm excited about this position because it aligns perfectly with my skills in data analysis and my interest in the healthcare industry. I've been following your company's innovative approach to improving patient outcomes through data-driven solutions, and I'm particularly impressed by your recent project on predictive analytics for preventive care. I believe my experience in building machine learning models and my passion for healthcare can contribute to your mission, and I'm eager to be part of a team that's making a real difference in people's lives.",behavioral,beginner,standard
"Where do you see yourself in five years?","In five years, I see myself having grown into a technical leadership role where I can mentor junior developers while still contributing to complex technical challenges. I'm passionate about continuous learning, so I plan to deepen my expertise in cloud architecture and distributed systems. I'm also interested in product strategy and hope to bridge the gap between technical implementation and business needs. Ultimately, I want to be in a position where I can make significant contributions to both the technical excellence and business success of the organization.",behavioral,intermediate,standard
"Explain the concept of a variable in programming.","A variable in programming is a named storage location in a computer's memory that holds a value that can be changed during program execution. It's like a labeled box where you can store data. Variables have a name (identifier), a type (such as integer, string, or boolean), and a value. For example, in Python, you can create a variable named 'age' and assign it the value 30 with the statement 'age = 30'. Variables are fundamental to programming because they allow us to store and manipulate data, making our code dynamic and reusable.",technical,beginner,standard
"What is a REST API?","A REST (Representational State Transfer) API is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses HTTP requests to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on resources, which are identified by URLs. REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request contains all the information needed to process it, and they typically return data in JSON or XML format. Key principles include a client-server architecture, cacheable responses, and a uniform interface. For example, a GET request to '/api/users' might return a list of users, while a POST request to the same endpoint would create a new user. REST APIs are widely used for building web services because they're scalable, simple to understand, and compatible with various clients.",technical,intermediate,standard
"How would you optimize a slow SQL query?","To optimize a slow SQL query, I'd follow a systematic approach. First, I'd use EXPLAIN or EXPLAIN ANALYZE to understand the query execution plan and identify bottlenecks. Common issues include missing indexes, inefficient joins, or retrieving unnecessary columns. I'd add appropriate indexes for columns used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses, ensuring they're selective enough to be useful. I'd rewrite the query to avoid functions on indexed columns, replace subqueries with joins where possible, and limit the data retrieved to only what's needed. For large tables, I might consider partitioning or using materialized views. I'd also check for proper database maintenance like statistics updates and regular vacuuming. Finally, I'd benchmark the optimized query to confirm the performance improvement. In a previous role, I reduced a report query's execution time from 2 minutes to 3 seconds by adding composite indexes and rewriting a correlated subquery as a join.",technical,advanced,standard
